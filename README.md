## Overview

Hydrological data is often collected over time and can be analyzed to understand patterns, anomalies, and trends. This project demonstrates how to use Python's data analysis and visualization libraries to:
- Import and manage hydrological data from Excel files.
- Perform time-series analysis using Pandas.
- Visualize time-series data effectively with Matplotlib.

## Features

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**:
   - Read hydrological data from Excel files using `pandas.read_excel()`.
   - Inspect and clean datasets for analysis.

2. **Time-Based Indexing**:
   - Utilize time-based indexing for selecting and filtering data.
   - Identify start and end dates for variables using `idxmin()` and `idxmax()`.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Plot time-series data using Matplotlib for insights.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Workshop_Py_Water.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the structured sections in the notebook:
   - Import Libraries
   - Import Data from Excel Files
   - DataFrame Indexing and Analysis
   - Visualization

3. Modify and extend the notebook as needed to suit your analysis.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `openpyxl` (for Excel file handling)

You can install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl
```
